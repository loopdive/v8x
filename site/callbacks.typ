= Callbacks and exceptions

JSC and QuickJS native callbacks cross an engine C frame before reaching Rust.
The trampoline does five things, in order:

+ restore the thread-local isolate and context; many ABI functions receive
  only a value pointer, so this state must already be in place
+ intern the receiver and arguments, which on QuickJS allocates arena slots
+ build the exact `FunctionCallbackInfo` pointer layout rusty_v8 expects
+ call the Rust callback, catching panics so they never unwind through
  engine frames
+ translate the return-value slot back into an engine value

The experimental js2wasm backend uses Wasmtime host imports instead of an
engine C trampoline. Values stay rooted in their compiled realm, and Rust
wrappers retain object identity. Synchronous nested callbacks use the active
Wasmtime caller to access that realm. Ordinary host callbacks and built-in
error transport are covered by focused tests; host construction, arbitrary
exotic values and complete exception identity are not implemented.

== Exceptions live in side state

JSC records the pending exception and its context in `IsoState` on every
call that can throw. QuickJS turns `JS_TAG_EXCEPTION` into
`JS_GetException`. `TryCatch`, `MaybeLocal`, and the message functions read
that stored state; they never ask the engine directly.

== IsoState

The implicit V8 machinery lives in one struct behind the opaque
`v8::Isolate` pointer:

#table(
  columns: 2,
  [*backend*], [*IsoState owns*],
  [JSC], [context group, global contexts, entered-context stack, protected
    locals, pending exception, weak records, GC callbacks],
  [QuickJS], [runtime, contexts, handle arena, persistent cells, module
    tables, snapshot state, promise hooks, interrupt state, memory counters],
)

One ordering rule: QuickJS sizes each context's class table at
`JS_NewContext`, so external-object and named-handler classes register
before the first context exists.

== Templates

Neither engine has V8's template concept. The template description
(properties, accessors, callbacks, internal-field count) lives in a native
adapter record, and instantiation reads it to build the real engine object.
Internal fields go in backend-owned records tied to the engine object; they
hold raw native pointers and stay invisible to JavaScript enumeration.
Function templates store the Rust callback and its data, then install the
trampoline above when materialized.
