= v8x

`v8x` makes rusty_v8 engine agnostic. It is a drop-in replacement for the
`v8` crate that keeps the same Rust API and runs it on a different
JavaScript engine:

```diff
-v8 = "149.4.0"
+v8 = { package = "v8x", version = "149.4.0", features = ["jsc"] }
```

Anything built on rusty_v8, including `deno_core` and Deno itself, compiles
unchanged and runs on the engine you picked.

== Engines

#table(
  columns: 3,
  [*engine*], [*feature*], [*platforms*],
  [JavaScriptCore (WebKit JSCOnly, built from source)], [`jsc`], [macOS],
  [JavaScriptCore (Apple's system framework)], [`system_jsc`], [macOS],
  [QuickJS-ng (vendored, static)], [`quickjs`], [any],
  [js2wasm AOT modules on Wasmtime (experimental)], [`engine_js2wasm`], [any],
)

The js2wasm backend is under active development. Its CI baseline currently
passes 132 of 429 `deno_core` tests; unsupported V8 ABI calls fail loudly.

One engine is active at a time. The usual reason to swap is binary size:

#table(
  columns: 3,
  [*engine*], [*deno binary*], [*engine size*],
  [V8 14.9], [78.7 MB], [\~40 MB static],
  [JSC (vendored)], [80.7 MB], [\~48 MB static],
  [system JSC], [54.2 MB], [0, ships with the OS],
  [quickjs-ng], [56.1 MB], [\~1 MB static],
)

== Progress

Two suites run unmodified against every backend: the rusty_v8 integration tests, and `deno_core`'s own test
suite under nextest. When a test fails, the backend gets fixed, not the
test.
